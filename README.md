Veritas is an app designed to give mental care providers solid, unbiased data regarding emotional state of their patients over a period of time. 

To achieve this, Veritas utilizes Microsoft’s neural-network based Emotion Recognition service to analyse photos sent from the patient’s device every time the patient uses his phone, regardless if the app is in use.  This ensures that the data is accurate and unbiased, while also ensuring a large data sample set is achieved. The analysis data can be viewed in-app as a table or as a graphical plot, or exported in an Excel-friendly format to the provider for professional analysis.

To run this demo, you will need a Microsoft EmotionService API client code.
